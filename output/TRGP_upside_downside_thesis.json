  "downside_thesis_summary": "• The company faces intense competition across all segments from major pipeline companies, master limited partnerships, producers, and other midstream providers, which could pressure pricing, market share, and contract terms, especially given some exposure to commodity price volatility through percent-of-proceeds contracts.  \n• Significant operational and supply chain risks exist, including hazards that may not be fully insured, aging pipeline infrastructure requiring costly maintenance, potential third-party facility unavailability, labor challenges, and volume variability that could materially impact income and cash flow.  \n• Large growth and maintenance capital expenditures relative to cash flow, combined with inflationary pressures and rising operating costs, may constrain free cash flow and margin sustainability if returns do not meet expectations or volumes decline.  \n• The company’s substantial outstanding debt and contractual obligations, including restrictive covenants and significant future interest payments, could limit operational flexibility and increase financial risk, with potential default risks if financial ratios are not maintained.  \n• Regulatory, market, and macro risks—including commodity price volatility, interest rate increases, climate change regulations, and changing tax laws—pose material threats to cash flows and profitability, while the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape maintains ongoing vulnerability despite governance efforts.",

Natural gas has a widely varying composition depending on the field, the formation and the reservoir from which it is produced.
