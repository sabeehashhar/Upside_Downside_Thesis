We believe that our proven operating model can be successfully adapted to these markets and where homebuilders, many of whom we currently serve elsewhere, would value our broad product and service offering, professional expertise, and superior customer service. When entering a new market, our strategy is to acquire market-leading distributors and subsequently expand their product offerings or add manufacturing facilities while integrating their operations into our centralized platform. This strategy allows us to quickly achieve the scale required to better serve our customers and leverage existing customer relationships in the local market. Our management has shown the capability to effectively and efficiently integrate newly acquired businesses, increase productivity, and drive value. We have successfully integrated over 75 acquisitions since 1998, including the company-transforming BMC and ProBuild transactions. Consistent capital allocation priorities. In addition to our acquisition strategy, we continue to focus on disciplined capital allocation to drive value creation. We actively monitor our working capital to align our needs with market demand signals and the size of our top-line.

However, the loss of, or an ongoing substantial decrease in the availability of products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.

We are operating in an uncertain economic environment. The global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, high rates of inflation, and uncertainty about economic stability and a potential recession. While our management team continually monitors market conditions and economic factors throughout our footprint, we are unable to predict the duration or severity of such conditions or factors. If conditions were to worsen nationally, regionally or locally, then we could see a decrease in housing starts, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. In addition, the financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by ongoing geopolitical conflicts, including those in Ukraine and the Middle East. These conflicts have impacted, and may continue to impact, commodity and energy prices, global supply chains and financial markets. In addition, sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries in response to the conflict in Ukraine could further adversely impact the financial markets and the global economy, and any economic countermeasures by the affected countries or others could exacerbate market and economic instability. The specific consequences of these geopolitical conflicts on our business are difficult to predict at this time, but in addition to inflationary pressures affecting our operations, any shortages of fuel or significant fuel cost increases could seriously disrupt our ability to distribute products to our customers.",

Unfavorable changes in demographics, credit markets, including rising mortgage and other interest rates, consumer confidence, household incomes, inflation, housing affordability, or housing inventory levels and occupancy, or a weakening of the U.S. economy or of any regional or local economy in which we operate could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for our products, and adversely affect our business. Production of new homes and multi-family buildings may also decline because of shortages of qualified tradesmen, reliance on inadequately capitalized builders and sub-contractors, shortages of suitable building lots and material, and lack of financing or more expensive financing available to homebuilders. In addition, the building industry is subject to various local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, and regulations concerning zoning, building design and safety, construction, energy and water conservation and similar matters, including regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area or in order to maintain certain areas as primarily or exclusively residential. Regulatory restrictions may increase our customers’ operating expenses and limit the availability of suitable building lots for our customers, which could negatively affect our sales and earnings.

The prices of wood products directly affect our sales and earnings. In particular, low prices for wood products over a sustained period can adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our lumber and lumber sheet goods product category represented 26% of total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024. As such, if lumber or structural panel prices were to significantly decline from current levels, our sales and profits could be negatively affected. We have limited ability to manage the timing and amount of pricing changes for building products. In addition, the supply of building products fluctuates based on available manufacturing capacity. Excess capacity in the industry can result in significant declines in prices for those building products, often within a short period of time.
