Since February 2025, the current United States presidential administration has imposed or threatened to impose tariffs in various jurisdictions. In April 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order to regulate imports by imposing reciprocal country specific tariffs on multiple nations around the world, including Vietnam and China. A further executive order issued in April 2025 paused the implementation of the country specific tariffs on Vietnam and many other countries for 90 days, maintaining a 10% global baseline tariff, while the United States works with its trade partners to negotiate new trade agreements. Significant tariffs remain in effect between the U.S. and China. The current situation is dynamic, and it is unknown if the United States and its trade partners will reach an agreement to further pause, reduce or eliminate the pending tariffs. Should these tariffs be enacted they could have a material impact on our future net sales, cost of goods sold in the United States, profit and cash flow. The ultimate effect will be dependent on the magnitude and duration of the tariffs and the countries implicated, as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, where we continue to actively assess and implement mitigation options.",

Foreign currency exposures arise from translation of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars and from transactions denominated in a currency other than a non-U.S. operation’s functional currency. We realized net (losses) gains associated with foreign currency translation of $(1.9) million, $(1.9) million and $(3.8) million for the years ended March 31, 2025, 2024 or 2023, respectively, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Although we assess our banking and customer relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect us, the financial services industry, or the economy in general. These factors could include, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry. In addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and more restrictive financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating expenses, financial obligations, or fulfill our other obligations.

In addition, supply chain shortages and cost increases due to new or increased tariffs have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our manufacturing costs and logistics costs and, in turn, our gross margins. We may also be required to pay higher prices for raw materials due to inflationary trends regardless of supply. In addition, changing interest rates could materially adversely affect our business. In response to increasing inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates in March 2022. Although the Federal Reserve began reducing the federal funds rate in late 2024 as a response to weakening inflation, there is no guarantee that the Federal Reserve will continue to reduce rates or that further changes in inflationary conditions will not occur. We are unable to predict changes in the Federal Reserve’s policies, the macroeconomic factors that influence those policies nor the impact that future changes will have on the economy and our business. Current or future efforts by the government to manage inflationary pressures or stimulate the economy may result in unintended economic consequences, which could have a direct and indirect adverse impact on our business and results of operations. While we believe many challenges are temporary and can be managed in the near-term, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by prolonged or increasing supply chain disruptions. Availability and cost of raw materials could be affected by a number of factors, including the cost of reliable energy; commodity prices; inflation; tariffs and duties on imported materials; foreign currency exchange rates; and phases of the general business cycle and global demand.

The exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a variety of reasons, including general economic conditions and event-driven circumstances. A depreciation of these currencies against the U.S. dollar will decrease the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts derived from these operations reported in our consolidated financial statements, and an appreciation of these currencies will result in a corresponding increase in such amounts. Because many of our raw material costs are determined with respect to the U.S. dollar rather than these currencies, depreciation of these currencies may have an adverse effect on our profit margins or our reported results of operations. Conversely, to the extent that we are required to pay for goods or services in foreign currencies, the appreciation of such currencies against the U.S. dollar will tend to negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the comparability of our results of operations between financial periods.
