In addition, the 2025 Partnership has agreed to acquire 46 on-lease narrowbody aircraft from us for an estimated net purchase price of $549 million and has signed an agreement through which our MRE business will exclusively provide replacement aircraft engines and modules for the life of the partnership. We will provide aircraft management services to the 2025 Partnership, and the Company will receive customary, market-based compensation for providing such services. The Company has also committed to make a minority investment in the 2025 Partnership. We expect to provide aircraft management services to, and make minority investments in, future partnerships.",

In addition to relying on our own experience, we source new opportunities through our network of industry relationships in order to find, structure and execute attractive acquisitions. These relationships include senior executives at industry leading operators, end users of the assets as well as banks, lenders and other asset owners. We believe that sourcing assets both globally and through multiple channels will enable us to find the most attractive opportunities. We are selective in the assets we pursue and efficient in the manner in which we pursue them. Once attractive opportunities are identified, our Company performs detailed due diligence on each of our potential acquisitions. Due diligence on each of our assets always includes a comprehensive review of the asset itself as well as the industry and market dynamics, competitive positioning, and financial and operational performance. Where appropriate, our Company conducts physical inspections, a review of the credit quality of each of our counterparties, the regulatory environment, and a review of all material documentation. In some cases, third-party specialists are hired to physically inspect and/or value the target assets. We also spend a significant amount of time on structuring our acquisitions to minimize risks while also optimizing expected returns. We employ what we believe to be reasonable amounts of leverage in connection with our acquisitions.
